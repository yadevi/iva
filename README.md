This package implements methods proposed in Zhang et al. (2019) (under review) for conducting Mendelian randomization analysis, a special case of instrumental variable analysis, under case-control studies. It provides a quasi Empirical Likelihood (EL) estimate for the causal effect of a quantitative exposure to a binary outcome, a Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for testing the exposure effect, and a test for the presence of confounder. The EL estimate is less biased, and the LM test is more powerful than those of the IVW and two-stage regression methods. A test for pleiotropic effects in instruments is coming soon.
