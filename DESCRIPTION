Description: Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis is a special case of instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments. It is used to estimate the unconfounded causal effect of an exposure. This package implements estimating and testing methods in Zhang et al. (2019) for MR analysis in case-control studies. It (1) estimates the causal effect of a quantitative exposure by the quasi empirical likelihood approach; (2) uses Lagrange multiplier test for testing the presence of causal; (3) provides a test for the presence of confounder.
